## Projects
### CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION IN A BANK USING ANN [link]
• Managed imbalance in data using three techniques and created a function to build Neural Network for
each technique, which resulted in reduction of execution time by 80%.
• Visualized neural network, epoch accuracy, epoch loss using Tensorboard, leading to 50% less time in
understanding performance of Neural Network.
### FLOWER CLASSIFICATION USING CNN [link]
• Devised a deep-learning model with 3670 images using CNN, improved model accuracy by 5 % using
  Dropout layer approach.
• Implemented transfer learning using a pre-trained model, which increased accuracy of model by 25%.
  HANDWRITTEN DIGITS CLASSIFICATION (PCA + CLASSIFICATION) [link]
• Designed handwritten digit recognition model that extracts features (328 from 786) using PCA, and classifies the digits using Random Forest algorithm with 95% accuracy.
